By harnessing the collective intelligence and specialized capabilities of autonomous agents, you can unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, scalability, and robustness in your applications, paving the way for the next generation of intelligent software.\n",

            "\n",
            "At its core, a MAS is a collection of autonomous agents, each designed to perform specific tasks and interact with each other and their environment. These aren't just isolated functions; they're intelligent entities that can be proactive, reactive, and socially adept. Why is this approach gaining traction now? The explosion of distributed systems, advancements in AI, and the ever-growing demand for sophisticated software solutions make MAS a timely and potent solution.\n",
            "\n",
            "The beauty of MAS lies in its embrace of specialization. Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable sub-problems, each assigned to a dedicated agent. This modular design not only promotes reusability and abstraction, simplifying integration, but also significantly enhances maintainability. Isolating functionality within agents means debugging and updates are more targeted, dramatically reducing the risk of cascading failures.\n",

This adaptability extends to self-optimization; MAS can learn from their interactions, continuously improving their effectiveness over time.\n",

This could be extracted into a helper method or calculated once before the loop for better readability and maintainability.\n",

While this is useful for immediate feedback, in a larger application, you might want to separate the logic from the UI and return values instead of printing directly, allowing the caller to decide how to present the information.\n",
            "*   **Magic Strings for Goal Types:** The `view_progress` method uses string literals (\"weekly\\_duration\", \"weekly\\_calories\", etc.) to identify goal types. Using constants or an Enum for these goal types would make the code less prone to typos and easier to manage if goal types change.\n",

            "InitialWriterAgent > The dust of Oakhaven settled on everything, a fine, ochre powder that coated the windowsills, the faded signage of the general store, and the worried faces of its inhabitants. It was a town where everyone knew everyone, and news travelled faster than a ute on a dirt track. So, when seven-year-old Lily Abernathy went missing, the silence that descended was deafening, a heavy blanket of dread that smothered the usual chirpy greetings and neighbourly gossip.\n",
            "\n",
            "Detective Sergeant Ray Maxwell, a man whose face was as weathered as the Oakhaven landscape, felt the weight of that silence in his bones. He’d been a cop in this region for twenty years, seen his share of petty thefts and domestic disputes, but a missing child? That was a wound that bled the whole community. He stood on Lily’s porch, the bright pink bicycle lying forlornly on its side on the lawn, a stark splash of colour against the muted tones of the rural afternoon.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Her mother, Sarah, she’s beside herself, Ray,” Constable Emily Carter said, her young face etched with concern. Emily was Oakhaven’s only other officer, fresh out of the academy and eager, but still learning the quiet anxieties of a place like this. “Says Lily was playing in the yard, just like always. She went inside for five minutes to make a cuppa, and when she came back out… gone.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray knelt, his knees protesting, and ran a gloved finger over the dust on the bike’s handlebar. No scuff marks, no signs of a struggle. Lily wasn’t the type to wander off without her treasured possession. She was a creature of habit, her days as predictable as the rising sun: breakfast with Mum, school, piano practice, then an hour in the yard with her bike.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Anyone see anything unusual?” Ray asked, his gaze sweeping over the neat, but slightly unkempt, garden. A few wilting roses, a patch of hardy native shrubs, the ubiquitous eucalyptus trees casting long shadows as evening approached.\n",
            "\n",
            "Emily shook her head. “Mrs. Gable next door was gardening, but she said she didn’t see Lily leave the yard. Just assumed she was inside. Old Man Fitzwilliam was out mending his fence on the other side of the road, but he’s half-deaf and his eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Said he heard nothing out of the ordinary.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray sighed. In Oakhaven, “nothing out of the ordinary” was a rare commodity, usually meaning something was very much out of the ordinary. He stood up, dusting his hands on his trousers. “We’ll need to canvas the immediate area. Every house, every shed. Talk to everyone who was out and about today. And get a perimeter search organised. The local volunteers will be here soon.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The next few hours were a blur of activity. The Oakhaven community, usually so laid-back, rallied with a fierce, protective instinct. Farmers in their beat-up utes, mothers with toddlers strapped to their chests, even the usually grumpy teenagers, all fanned out across the paddocks, their voices echoing with Lily’s name. Ray and Emily coordinated the search, their radios crackling with increasingly disheartening reports. No sign. No sightings.\n",
            "\n",
            "As darkness fell, casting an eerie, star-studded canvas over the land, a different kind of fear began to creep in. The fear of the unknown, the primal fear of predators lurking in the shadows. Ray watched the beams of flashlights crisscrossing the bushland, a fragile barrier against the encroaching night.\n",
            "\n",
            "Back at the makeshift command post in the Oakhaven RSL, Sarah Abernathy sat hunched in a chair, her eyes red-rimmed and vacant. Her husband, David, a quiet man who worked at the local sawmill, held her hand, his own face a mask of helpless anguish. Ray approached them, his heart heavy.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Sarah, David, we’re doing everything we can. The search will continue through the night. Have you thought of anyone, anyone at all, who might want to…?” He trailed off, the word ‘kidnap’ feeling too monstrous to utter in this peaceful setting.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sarah shook her head, her voice a thin, reedy whisper. “No. Lily is… she’s just a child. Who would do this? We don’t have enemies.”\n",
            "\n",
            "David’s grip tightened on Sarah’s hand. “She’s a good kid, Sergeant. No trouble. Everyone likes Lily.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray believed them. The Abernathys were pillars of the Oakhaven community, salt-of-the-earth people. This wasn’t a crime of passion or revenge. This was something else. Something colder.\n",
            "\n",
            "Over the next two days, the search intensified. State police reinforcements arrived, their high-tech equipment a stark contrast to Oakhaven’s rustic charm. Helicopters buzzed overhead, thermal imaging cameras scanned the landscape, but still, nothing. The whispers in Oakhaven grew louder, tinged with fear and speculation. Was it a stranger? Or someone from within? The thought was almost unbearable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray felt the pressure mounting. Every passing hour brought them closer to the chilling reality that Lily might be… He couldn’t let himself go there. He spent hours poring over Lily’s life, her school records, her friendships, anything that might offer a clue. He interviewed Lily’s classmates, their innocent pronouncements offering little solace. “Lily likes drawing unicorns,” one little girl had said. “She has a sparkly backpack,” another offered.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, a break. A farmer, Mr. Henderson, out checking his fences miles from town, remembered seeing a dusty, older model utility vehicle driving erratically along a disused fire trail late on Tuesday afternoon, the day Lily disappeared. He hadn’t thought much of it at the time, dismissed it as a local farmer getting lost. But now…\n",
            "\n",
            "“Can you describe the vehicle, Mr. Henderson?” Ray asked, leaning in, his voice urgent.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Yeah, I think so. Dark green, kinda rusty around the wheel arches. Had a dent in the passenger side door. And… there was something on the back. Looked like a cage. A small one, like for a dog or something, but it was empty then.”\n",
            "\n",
            "A cage. The word sent a shiver down Ray’s spine. It wasn’t a random snatch-and-grab. This was planned.\n",
            "\n",
            "Emily, working tirelessly on the phone, managed to cross-reference the vehicle description with recent police logs and local registrations. Nothing matched perfectly, but there was a potential lead: an unregistered, older model utility vehicle, dark green, previously owned by a transient worker who had done odd jobs around the district a few months ago and then disappeared. His name was Silas Croft. He’d been known to be reclusive, strange, and had a history of minor offences, mostly related to animal cruelty.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Animal cruelty?” Sarah Abernathy whispered, her eyes widening with a fresh wave of horror when Ray relayed this information. “Oh God…”\n",
            "\n",
            "Silas Croft. The name meant nothing to the Abernathys. He wasn’t on any of the usual social circles in Oakhaven. He was an outsider, a ghost. But he was a ghost with a rusty ute and a cage.\n",

            "Ray and Emily, along with a team of officers, mobilised. They followed the vague directions Croft had been last seen heading, towards the old, abandoned gold mining leases that dotted the rugged country north of Oakhaven. It was desolate territory, a maze of scrub, rocky outcrops, and forgotten shafts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hours later, deep into the scrub, a keen-eyed officer spotted it: a glint of rust on a partially hidden fire trail. The utility vehicle. It was parked behind a thicket of acacia trees, partially concealed.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Police! Silas Croft! Come out with your hands up!” Ray’s voice boomed, amplified by the stillness of the bush.\n",
            "\n",
            "Silence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cautiously, they approached the vehicle. The cage was still on the back, empty. Inside the ute, they found some empty food wrappers, a crumpled sleeping bag, and a collection of small, carved wooden animals. Nothing that screamed ‘child kidnapper’, but the overall impression was one of squalor and isolation.\n",
            "\n",
            "They searched the immediate vicinity. The silence was unnerving. Had Croft heard them and fled? Or was he hiding somewhere nearby?\n",
            "\n",
            "Suddenly, Emily, who had a knack for spotting the unusual, pointed towards a narrow crevice in a rock face, almost hidden by overgrown vines. “Sergeant, look. There’s some movement. And… is that a piece of pink fabric?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray’s heart leaped into his throat. He moved closer, his hand on his sidearm. The crevice was too narrow for him to fit through. “Emily, can you get closer? See what it is.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Emily, small and agile, squeezed through the opening. A moment later, her voice, trembling but clear, echoed out. “Ray! It’s her! It’s Lily! She’s… she’s okay. Scared, but okay.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Relief washed over Ray, so potent it made his knees weak. He peered into the crevice. Lily, pale and wide-eyed, was huddled in a small, natural alcove. Beside her, cowering, was Silas Croft. He looked more pathetic than menacing, a gaunt, middle-aged man with a wild look in his eyes, clutching a crudely carved wooden bird.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Silas Croft,” Ray said, his voice calm but firm, “you’re under arrest for the abduction of Lily Abernathy.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Croft didn’t resist. He looked up at Ray, his eyes filled with a strange mixture of fear and bewilderment. “She… she was lost,” he stammered. “I found her by the creek. She was crying. I… I didn’t want her to be alone. I brought her here to keep her safe.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Ray exchanged a look with Emily. Safe? In this dark, damp crevice? It was a warped perception of safety, born of isolation and a desperate loneliness. Croft had likely found Lily after she’d wandered off from her yard, perhaps chasing a butterfly or a particularly interesting insect, and taken her to his makeshift shelter, convinced he was protecting her from the 'dangers' of the outside world. His actions, while horrific in their intent to abduct, stemmed from a deeply disturbed mind, not malice in the conventional sense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Emily carefully coaxed Lily out of the crevice. The little girl, clinging to Emily like a limpet, looked back at Croft with a mixture of fear and confusion. He held out the wooden bird to her.\n",
            "\n",
            "“For you,” he mumbled. “So you won’t be scared.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Lily, after a moment’s hesitation, reached out and took the bird. It was a small, unexpected gesture of grace in a situation filled with trauma.\n",
            "\n",
            "The drive back to Oakhaven was tense. Lily was examined by paramedics, miraculously unharmed except for a few scratches and a severe case of shock. As the news spread, the town erupted. Car horns blared, people poured out of their homes, cheering and crying with relief.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sarah and David rushed to Lily, their reunion a heart-wrenching scene of pure, unadulterated joy. Lily, clutching the wooden bird, looked up at her parents, a fragile smile finally gracing her lips.\n",
            "\n",
            "Silas Croft was taken into custody, his fate to be decided by the courts. The investigation would continue, the finer details of his actions to be pieced together. But for Oakhaven, the immediate crisis was over. The suffocating silence had been broken, replaced by the sound of weeping, laughter, and the gentle chirping of birds returning to their song.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Ray watched Lily being embraced by her relieved parents, the ochre dust of Oakhaven seemed a little less oppressive. He knew the scars of this event would remain, a somber reminder of how quickly peace could be shattered, even in the quietest of places. But he also saw the resilience of this small community, their ability to come together in the face of darkness, to find their lost child, and to reclaim their peace. The pink bicycle, now leaning against the Abernathys' porch, seemed to represent not just Lily’s absence, but her triumphant return. Oakhaven, for all its dust and quiet ways, had found its way back to the light.\n",
