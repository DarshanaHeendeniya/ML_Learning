            "CodeReviewerAgent > *   **Input Validation:** The code lacks robust input validation for user creation and activity logging. For instance, `int(input(\"Enter age: \"))` will crash if the user enters non-numeric input. Similarly, `float(input(\"Enter weight (kg): \"))` and `float(input(\"Enter height (m): \"))` will fail on invalid input. It would be better to use a `try-except` block to handle `ValueError` and prompt the user again.\n",
            "*   **BMI Calculation Edge Case:** The `calculate_bmi` method correctly handles `self.height <= 0`. However, if the user enters a non-positive height, the `get_bmi_category` method receives a string and returns it. While this prevents a crash, it might be more user-friendly to display an error message directly or handle the string return more explicitly within `get_bmi_category`.\n",
            "*   **Type Hinting:** Adding type hints (e.g., `name: str`, `age: int`) to method signatures would improve code readability and maintainability, especially for larger projects.\n",
            "*   **Error Handling in `set_goal`:** The `set_goal` method takes `target_value` as a string. Depending on the `goal_type`, it might be beneficial to convert `target_value` to a more appropriate type (e.g., `float` for weight loss, `int` for steps) if possible, or at least include a note or validation for expected types.\n",
            "*   **Separation of Concerns (UI vs. Logic):** The `FitnessApp` class handles both the user interface (menu, input prompts) and the core application logic (managing users, logging activities). For larger applications, separating these concerns into different classes or modules (e.g., a `UI` class) would lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
            "*   **Magic Numbers/Strings:** The BMI thresholds (18.5, 24.9, etc.) and menu choices ('1', '2', etc.) are hardcoded. Defining these as constants at the beginning of the script or within the relevant classes would improve readability and make it easier to modify them later.\n",
            "*   **Date Handling in `log_activity`:** While `datetime.date.today()` is used when no date is provided, it might be useful to allow users to input a specific date for logging activities, and to validate that input as well.\n",
            "*   **BMI Calculation Formatting:** The `__str__` method formats the BMI to two decimal places using `{self.calculate_bmi():.2f}`. This is good, but it assumes `calculate_bmi` will always return a number. If `calculate_bmi` returns a string (e.g., \"Height must be positive.\"), this formatting will cause a `TypeError`. This could be addressed by checking the return type of `calculate_bmi` before formatting.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Elaborate on Elias's reaction and immediate thoughts:** While his heart thrums, it would be beneficial to delve slightly deeper into his immediate internal reaction. Is it fear, awe, scientific curiosity, or a sense of destiny? Showing a brief flicker of his thought process as he encounters the alien star map could enhance his characterization and the reader's connection to his experience.\n",
            "2.  **Hint at the implications of the map:** The map shows \"stars he'd never seen.\" This is a great hook. Consider adding a sentence or two that hints at what this discovery *could* mean. Is it a navigation chart to another world, a prophecy, or something else entirely? Even a subtle suggestion can raise the stakes and draw the reader further into the mystery.\n",
            "3.  **Strengthen the sensory details of the tablet:** Beyond the glowing lines, the description of the obsidian tablet could be more evocative. What does it feel like to the touch? Is it cold, warm, smooth, or does it have a subtle texture? Adding a brief sensory detail beyond the visual would make the discovery more tangible.\n",

There, lodged in the rocks, was not a piece of wreckage, but a smooth, obsidian tablet. As his calloused fingers brushed against its surface, it felt unnervingly warm, like a living thing. Intricate lines of pure, vibrant light bloomed across its surface, forming a map of stars he’d never seen. His breath hitched. This was no mere celestial chart; it felt like an invitation, a key to a destiny far grander and more terrifying than his solitary life had ever promised.\n",
